** What is this?

   An Emacs library that allows Org mode to evaluate code blocks using
   a Jupyter kernel (Python by default).

** How do I install this?

*** First, you need IPython

    Before installing, you'll need Jupyter (>= 1.0) and IPython (>=
    5.0) installed and working. You will also need the [[http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html][Jupyter]] console
    and client (~jupyter_console~, ~jupyter_client~) libraries. All of
    this should be trivially installable using pip.

*** Install the Emacs plugin

    This package is in MELPA. I recommend installing from there.

    Otherwise, for manual installation, you'll need the following
    elisp dependencies first:

    * https://github.com/magnars/dash.el
    * https://github.com/magnars/s.el
    * https://github.com/rejeep/f.el

    Then just drop this somewhere in your load path and ~(require
    'ob-ipython)~.

    Lastly, activate ~ipython~ in Org-Babel:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (org-babel-do-load-languages
       'org-babel-load-languages
       '((ipython . t)
         ;; other languages..
         ))
    #+END_SRC

** How do I use it?

   Open an org file, add a SRC block and evaluate as you would any Org
   SRC block (usually =C-c C-c=). Here I will run through some example
   blocks.

   This is the most basic ipython block. You *must* provide a session
   argument. You can name the session if you wish to separate state.
   You can also pass a connection json of an existing ipython session
   as a session name in order to connect to it.

   The result returned by ob-ipython should be renderable by org so
   it's recommended to always use ~:results raw drawer~.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results raw drawer
       %matplotlib inline
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       import numpy as np
     ,#+END_SRC
   #+END_SRC

   Here we evaluate some code with a function definition using a named
   session.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mysession :exports both :results raw drawer
       def foo(x):
           return x + 9

       [foo(x) + 7 for x in range(7)]
     ,#+END_SRC

     ,#+RESULTS:
     : [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]
   #+END_SRC

   To get a graphic out, you must ensure that you have evaluated
   ~%matplotlib inline~ first. A file will be generated for you (see
   the ~ob-ipython-resources-dir~ custom var if you want to change the
   path).

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
       plt.hist(np.random.randn(20000), bins=200)
     ,#+END_SRC
   #+END_SRC

   If you provide an ipyfile argument, this filename will be used
   instead of generating one.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :ipyfile /tmp/image.png :exports both :results raw drawer
       plt.hist(np.random.randn(20000), bins=200)
     ,#+END_SRC
   #+END_SRC

   In order to make an svg graphic rather than a png, you may specify
   the output format globally to IPython.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   If you wish to use a specific Jupyter kernel, you may pass the
   kernel option. This enables you to use ob-ipython with languages
   other than Python. You need to have the Jupyter kernel installed
   and working before you can use this.

   When mixing code from different languages you will need to make use
   of the session argument.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :kernel clojure
       (+ 1 2)
     ,#+END_SRC

     ,#+RESULTS:
     : 3
   #+END_SRC

   ob-ipython supports providing variables and even tables to code.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+TBLNAME: data_table
     | a | 1 | 2 |
     | b | 2 | 3 |
     | c | 3 | 4 |

     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :var x=2 :var data=data_table
       (x, data)
     ,#+END_SRC

     ,#+RESULTS:
     : (2, [['a', 1, 2], ['b', 2, 3], ['c', 3, 4]])
   #+END_SRC

   Asynchronous execution is supported. Use the ~:async t~ option.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :ipyfile /tmp/image.png :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
       import time
       time.sleep(3)
       plt.hist(np.random.randn(20000), bins=200)
     ,#+END_SRC
   #+END_SRC

** Experimental: Jupyter kernel support

   This package is starting to transition from the original
   ipython-only support to full jupyter support.

   If you have other kernels installed, you should be able to evaluate
   blocks by providing jupyter-X as the language, where X is the
   language name recognised by jupyter. For example, you can do
   something like this:

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-R :results raw drawer
       x <- 3
       x
     ,#+END_SRC
   #+END_SRC

   Notice, when providing languages like this, you do not need to
   (although you may) provide a session argument. A default session is
   created per language. This should also try to provide support for
   per-language modes when editing.

** Working with a remote session

First, follow the instructions [[https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Cookbook:-Connecting-to-a-remote-kernel-via-ssh][here]] to get access to a remote kernel.
You can then pass the name of the local json file as a session arg to
use this tunnel.

Essentially the instructions boil down to

- scp the remote json file over (will be in =/run/user/*/jupyter/=)
- use =jupyter console --existing ./kernel-remote.json --ssh
  remote-host= to connect locally. This will give you a prompt that
  should allow you to evaluate expressions locally but have them run
  on the remote machine.
- use the newly created local config file printed by the previous step
  as the argument to =:session=. Be sure to include the =.json= suffix
  so that ob-ipython knows to use this as the config rather than
  spawning a new session.

** What features are there outside of Org SRC block evaluation?

   * You can ask the running IPython kernel for documentation. Open a
     SRC block, place the point on the thing you're interested in and
     run =M-x ob-ipython-inspect=. I recommend you bind this to a key.

   * ~ob-ipython-completions~ queries the kernel for completions at a
     position. You may use this to hook up any completion mechanism.
     We already provide a company backend. With company installed, add
     ~(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-ob-ipython)~ somewhere
     in your config. This should then work while editing a src block.

   * It's often easier to play with code using a REPL. With the point
     in an ipython SRC block, you can open a REPL connected to the
     current kernel by running =C-c C-v C-z=.

   * If evaluated code produces an error, this will be displayed
     nicely in a buffer using IPython's traceback support.

   * Stdout/err from code evaluation is displayed in a popup buffer.
     This is great for debugging or getting verbose output that is
     best left out of documents (e.g progress updates). If you wish to
     capture output in your document use the =:results output= SRC
     block header.

   * You can interrupt or kill a running kernel. This is helpful if
     things get stuck or really broken. See =M-x
     ob-ipython-interrupt-kernel= and =M-x ob-ipython-kill-kernel=,
     respectively.

** Tips and tricks

   Here are a few things I have setup to make life better. These
   aren't provided with ob-ipython, but are recommended.

   * Be sure to use ~%matplotlib inline~, otherwise graphics won't work.

   * I use yasnippet to create src blocks. Here is the snippet I use.
     It takes care of generating unique file names (when I want one)
     so I don't have to think about this.

     #+BEGIN_SRC snippet
       # -*- mode: snippet -*-
       # name: ipython block
       # key: py
       # --
       ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session ${1::ipyfile ${2:$$(let ((temporary-file-directory "./")) (make-temp-file "py" nil ".png"))} }:exports ${3:both}
       $0
       ,#+END_SRC
     #+END_SRC

     These days I use this more often:

     #+BEGIN_SRC snippet
       ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :results raw drawer
         $0
       ,#+END_SRC
     #+END_SRC

   * I use the following Org settings:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)   ;don't prompt me to confirm everytime I want to evaluate a block

       ;;; display/update images in the buffer after I evaluate
       (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-display-inline-images 'append)
     #+END_SRC

   * Export with the =LaTeX= backend using the =minted= package for
     source block highlighting fails for =ipython= blocks by default
     with the error
     : Error: no lexer for alias 'ipython' found

     To use the =python= lexer for =ipython= blocks, add this setting:
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (add-to-list 'org-latex-minted-langs '(ipython "python"))
     #+END_SRC

   # * Install pandoc and anything ipython renders as html will be
   #   converted to org. This is mostly useful for getting nice tables
   #   automatically.

   * ob-ipython will display anything back from ipython with the mime
     type 'text/org' verbatim. This allows you and others to create
     [[https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2014/02/11/altering-display-existing-classes-ipython/][formatters]] that output raw org. For example, drop this in your
     ipython startup file to have arrays and dataframes rendered as
     org tables:

     #+BEGIN_SRC python
       import IPython
       from tabulate import tabulate

       class OrgFormatter(IPython.core.formatters.BaseFormatter):
           def __call__(self, obj):
               try:
                   return tabulate(obj, headers='keys',
                                   tablefmt='orgtbl', showindex='always')
               except:
                   return None

       ip = get_ipython()
       ip.display_formatter.formatters['text/org'] = OrgFormatter()
     #+END_SRC

** Help, it doesn't work

   First thing to do is check that you have all of the required
   dependencies. Several common problems have been resolved in the
   project's issues, so take a look there to see if your problem has a
   quick fix. Otherwise feel free to cut an issue - I'll do my best to
   help.

** Alternatives
*** Why not use IPython notebook?

    I tried using the IPython notebook but quickly became frustrated
    with trying to write code in a web browser. This provides another
    option for creating documents containing executable Python code,
    but in Emacs - with everything that entails.

*** Why not use [[https://millejoh.github.io/emacs-ipython-notebook/][EIN]]?

    EIN is really great. It kept me happy for quite a while but I
    started to feel constrained by the cell format of IPython
    notebooks. What I really wanted was to embed code in Org
    documents. It's hard to compete with Org mode! A few key points in
    favour of Org:

    * In my opinion, Org's markup is better than Markdown.
    * Org's organisational, editing and navigation facilities are much
      better than EIN.
    * Org's tables...
    * Org can export to multiple formats.
    * I like how Org opens a new buffer when editing code so that you
      can use a Python major mode rather than trying to handle
      multiple major modes in one.

    I also found myself hitting bugs in EIN where evaluation and doc
    lookup would just stop working. I regularly had to kill and reopen
    buffers or restart the IPython kernel and this was getting
    frustrating.

*** How does this compare to regular Org Python integration (ob-python)?

    I think this is more robust. The executed code is sent to a
    running IPython kernel which has an architecture designed for this
    purpose. The way ob-python works feels like a bit of a hack. I ran
    in to race conditions using ob-python where the Org buffer would
    update its results before the Python REPL had finished evaluating
    the code block. This is what eventually drove me to write this.

    It's easier to get plots and images out of this. I also provide
    several features I missed when using plain ob-python, such as
    looking up documentation and getting IPython-style tracebacks when
    things go wrong.

    You can also use IPython-specific features such as ~%timeit~.
