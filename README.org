** What is this?

   An Emacs library that allows Org mode to evaluate Python code
   blocks using an IPython kernel.

*** Why not use IPython notebook?

    I tried using the IPython notebook but quickly became frustrated
    with trying to write code in a web browser. This provides another
    option for creating documents containing executable Python code,
    but in Emacs - with everything that entails.

*** Why not use [[https://millejoh.github.io/emacs-ipython-notebook/][EIN]]?

    EIN is really great. It kept me happy for quite a while but I
    started to feel constrained by the cell format of IPython
    notebooks. What I really wanted was to embed code in Org
    documents. It's hard to compete with Org mode! A few key points in
    favour of Org:

    * In my opinion, Org's markup is better than Markdown.
    * Org's organisational, editing and navigation facilities are much
      better than EIN.
    * Org's tables...
    * Org can export to multiple formats.
    * I like how Org opens a new buffer when editing code so that you
      can use a Python major mode rather than trying to handle
      multiple major modes in one.

    I also found myself hitting bugs in EIN where evaluation and doc
    lookup would just stop working. I regularly had to kill and reopen
    buffers or restart the IPython kernel and this was getting
    frustrating.

*** How does this compare to regular Org Python integration (ob-python)?

    I think this is more robust. The executed code is sent to a
    running IPython kernel which has an architecture designed for this
    purpose. The way ob-python works feels like a bit of a hack. I ran
    in to race conditions using ob-python where the Org buffer would
    update its results before the Python REPL had finished evaluating
    the code block. This is what eventually drove me to write this.

    It's easier to get plots and images out of this. I also provide
    several features I missed when using plain ob-python, such as
    looking up documentation and getting IPython-style tracebacks when
    things go wrong.

    You can also use IPython-specific features such as ~%timeit~.

** How do I install this?
In version 4.0, [[http://ipython.org/][IPython]] has transitioned from a monolithic architecture to being a just one of the kernels supported by the more generic [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]] application framework. Begining with version 4.0 of the IPython kernel the Jupyter console application is actually responsible for the REPL interface. Therefore, depending on the selected or available software the appropriate branch of this repository should be selected.
*** ~master~ branch for Jupyter with IPython kernel >= 4.0
   Before installing, you'll need Jupyter (>= 1.0) and the IPython kernel (>= 4.0) installed and
   working. You will also need the [[http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/][Tornado]] and [[http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html][Jupyter]] console and client (~jupyter_console~, ~jupyter_client~) libraries.
*** ~ipython3~ branch for IPython >=3.0 && < 4.0
   If you're on IPython 3 you can use the ~ipython3~ branch of this
   repository. You will also need the [[http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/][Tornado]] and [[https://zeromq.github.io/pyzmq/][PyZMQ]] libraries. These libraries are usually installed as dependecnies of the ipython notebook.
   

   This package is now in MELPA. I recommend installing from there.
   For manual installation, you'll need the following elisp
   dependencies first:

   * https://github.com/magnars/dash.el
       * Including dash-functional
   * https://github.com/magnars/s.el
   * https://github.com/rejeep/f.el

   Then just drop this somewhere in your load path and ~(require 'ob-ipython)~.

** How do I use it?

   Open an org file, add a SRC block and evaluate as you would any Org
   SRC block (usually =C-c C-c=). Here I will run through some example
   blocks.

   This is the most basic ipython block. You *must* provide a session
   argument. You can name the session if you wish to separate state.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session
       %matplotlib inline
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       import numpy as np
     ,#+END_SRC
   #+END_SRC

   Here we evaluate some code with a function definition using a named
   session.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mysession :exports both
       def foo(x):
           return x + 9

       [foo(x) + 7 for x in range(7)]
     ,#+END_SRC

     ,#+RESULTS:
     : [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]
   #+END_SRC

   This is how you can get a graphic out. Notice the file argument.
   This must be provided. You must also ensure that you have evaluated
   ~%matplotlib inline~ before evaluating this.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :file /tmp/image.png :exports both
       plt.hist(np.random.randn(20000), bins=200)
     ,#+END_SRC
   #+END_SRC

   ob-ipython supports providing variables and even tables to code.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
     ,#+TBLNAME: data_table
     | a | 1 | 2 |
     | b | 2 | 3 |
     | c | 3 | 4 |

     ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :var x=2 :var data=data_table
       (x, data)
     ,#+END_SRC

     ,#+RESULTS:
     : (2, [['a', 1, 2], ['b', 2, 3], ['c', 3, 4]])
   #+END_SRC

** What features are there outside of Org SRC block evaluation?

   * You can ask the running IPython kernel for documentation. Open a
     SRC block, place the point on the thing you're interested in and
     run =M-x ob-ipython-inspect=. I recommend you bind this to a key.

   * It's often easier to play with code using a REPL. With the point
     in an ipython SRC block, you can open a REPL connected to the
     current kernel by running =C-c C-v C-z=. I recommend you do this
     anyway, as python-mode can now use this REPL to provide
     completion in code buffers.

   * If evaluated code produces an error, this will be displayed
     nicely in a buffer using IPython's traceback support.

   * Stdout from code evaluation is displayed in a popup buffer. This
     is great for debugging or getting verbose output that is best
     left out of documents. If you wish to capture stdout in your
     document use the =:results output= SRC block header.

   * You can interrupt or kill a running kernel. This is helpful if
     things get stuck or really broken. See =M-x
     ob-ipython-interrupt-kernel= and =M-x ob-ipython-kill-kernel=,
     respectively.

** Tips and tricks

   Here are a few things I've setup to make life better. These aren't
   provided with ob-ipython but are recommended.

   * Be sure to use ~%matplotlib inline~, otherwise graphics won't work.

   * I use yasnippet to create src blocks. Here is the snippet I use.
     It takes care of generating unique file names (when I want one)
     so I don't have to think about this.

     #+BEGIN_SRC snippet
       # -*- mode: snippet -*-
       # name: ipython block
       # key: py
       # --
       ,#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session ${1::file ${2:$$(let ((temporary-file-directory "./")) (make-temp-file "py" nil ".png"))} }:exports ${3:both}
       $0
       ,#+END_SRC
     #+END_SRC

   * I use the following Org settings:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)   ;don't prompt me to confirm everytime I want to evaluate a block

       ;;; display/update images in the buffer after I evaluate
       (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-display-inline-images 'append)
     #+END_SRC

   * Open a REPL using =C-c C-v C-z= so that you get completion in Python buffers.

** Help, it doesn't work

   First thing to do is check that you have all of the required
   dependencies. Several common problems have been resolved in the
   project's issues, so take a look there to see if your problem has a
   quick fix. Otherwise feel free to cut an issue - I'll do my best to
   help.
